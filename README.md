# PokeMemory Game

This is a React-based web app, where you can play a simple memory game. Rack up high scores by avoiding clicking a previously clicked pokemon. This app uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to generate random pokemon.

## Achieved Learning Goals
* **React framework**: Used props and states to manage input data and rerendering.
* **Async code in React**: Used useEffect hook to handle asynchronous API fetching.
* **Storing data in React**: Used refs to reduce difficult recomputation of rendering-independent data.
* **Reponsive HTML**: Practiced creating responsive images and using media-queries to support all screens.

## Personal Takeaways
* Avoid creating states for values calculable from other states
* Use refs to store data that mutates, but isn't used directly for rendering like states
* Multiple promises (async code) can be waited for together using Promise.all(arrayOfPromises)
* Array.from() syntax and use cases
